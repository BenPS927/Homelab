This is my repo showing the progression of my homelab as I develop it on my journey into the world of IT

To sum it up, the lab consists of a router connected to a switch, connected to a laptop (IT support), a PC (servers) and another PC (Operations). Each represents a department of a business, with the idea of the lab being to simulate a real working IT environment so I can get hands on experience. Operations is used for running four virtual machines which make up a further two departments, Sales and Finance. 
                                    
      Current Focus: Active Directory and the Microsoft Ecosystem
