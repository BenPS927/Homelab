This is my hub for everything related to my continual development in IT and tech.

I started studying IT last october, starting with the absolute basics - binary, computer hardware, IP addressing. I've now built a functioning network in my bedroom using Cisco networking gear, and am in the process of adding various software and services to the lab. The goal is to simulate as closely as possible a real business networking environment.

I've also written a textbook on basic networking - writing is how I learn - and I'm now writing one based on the content of the Comptia Network plus certification.

The overall goal is to get a job - I'd like to get into some form of engineering or architecture (at the junior level of course), but I'm in no rush as I'm just enjoying learning.
