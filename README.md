I've undertaken the task of simulating, as best as possible, an enterprise IT environment at home, such as you'd find in a business.

The idea is to make myself as IT literate as possible to help me get my first job in IT, and once I've done that to have an environment to continue developing as a professional.

The set up consists of a router separating my lab from the existing home network, connecting to a switch which connects to my end devices. Each end device represents a department such as you may find in an office environment. These are management/IT, operations, and servers. This involves networking concepts I've learned through my studies and practiced in Cisco Packet Tracer. Each end device will have various software and systems running to simulate a real environment. The services provided by and systems running on each 'department' will eventually include all of the following:

Management/IT: Troubleshooting tools | Remote access tools | Network scanning tools

Operations: Cloud practice/setup | Security tools | Advanced networking simulations | Virtual machines for applying learning concepts| Pen testing tools

Servers: Monitoring tools | File storage and sharing | Network services

This list will surely grow as I look for more things to add, and eventually I'll work towards automating as much as possible.
